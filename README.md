# Sorting Visualization Web Application

The goal of this application is to visualize several fundamental sorting algorithms, such as bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort, heap sort and insertion sort. 

To see the application in action: https://panyuenlau.github.io/Sorting-Visualization-Project/

It would be greatly appreciated if you can give a star to my project or let me know what can be improved.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
